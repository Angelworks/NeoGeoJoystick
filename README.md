This is some artwork for a Hammond Manufacturing 1456PH1WHCWW - which you can get here: https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Hammond-Manufacturing/1456PH1WHCWW - the way I used it was I printed it on photo paper on an inkjet printer, and then covered that with plexiglass I got at a hardware store. You can purchase arcade buttons and joysticks on eBay that will work for this. I'll eventually post additional details on the exact parts that will work (some joysticks don't have enough clearance for the Hammond control box).

It was inspired by this post: https://www.neo-geo.com/forums/index.php?threads/finished-custom-joysticks.195950/ (who never posted the artwork...)
